Title: Legendrian Dualities and Geometry of Submanifolds

Abstract: Singularity and degeneracy destroy the structure of manifolds and give rise to essential difficulties in researching the deteriorative manifolds. Thus, it is crucial to develop new methods for investigating the singular or degenerate manifolds. By characterizing the inner connection between pseudo spheres in semi-Euclidean space, the Legendrian dualities are effective methods developed by L. Chen and Izumiya in 2009 for studying the submanifolds in non-flat space. Specially, the Legendrian duality is applicable for studying the singular or degenerate submanifolds. In this talk, we will introduce the basic notions of Legendrian dualities. As their applications, using the singularity theory of mappings, we investigate the topological and geometrical properties of the (singular or degenerate) submanifolds immersed in non-flat space from the viewpoint of duality.

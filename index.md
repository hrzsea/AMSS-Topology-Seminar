Title: Triangulated persistence category in symplectic geometry


Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce a new algebraic structure called triangulated persistence category (TPC). A TPC combines the persistence module structure (from topological data analysis) and the classical triangulated structure so that a meaningful measurement, via cone decomposition, can be defined on the set of objects. Moreover, a TPC structure allows us to define non-trivial pseudo-metrics on its Grothendieck group, which is the first time that people can study a Grothendieck group in terms of the metric geometry. Finally, we will illustrate several unexpected properties of a TPC via its supporting example in symplectic geometry, the derived Fukaya category. In particular, we can distinguish classes in the Grothendieck group of a derived Fukaya category from a quantitative perspective. This is based on joint work with Paul Biran and Octav Cornea.

Title: Shadows of Hodge Theory (or: Never Underestimate Symmetry!)


Abstract: This talk aims to advertise a pattern/phenomenon that has emerged in many different mathematical areas during the past decades but is not currently well-understood. I will begin with a broad overview of the Kahler packages (Poincare duality, Hard Lefschetz, and Hodge-Riemann relations) that appear in geometry, algebra, and combinatorics, from the classics of Lefschetz to the recent work of this year's Fields medalist June Huh, in a down-to-earth way. Then I will discuss two new Kahler packages we discovered that are equivariant and have no geometric origin. The equivariant log-concavity in representation theory hints at our discoveries. This talk will be non-technical and accessible to the general audience: nothing will be assumed other than elementary linear algebra. Partly based on joint work with Rui Xiong.

Title: Free circle actions on highly connected (2n+1)- manifolds


Abstract: A natural problem in topology is to determine which manifolds admit certain group actions. The problem we concern in this talk is to determine which highly connected (2n+1)-manifolds admit free circle actions. I will introduce some previous work and our progress on this problem.

Title: Legendrian knots and cluster algebras via augmentations


Abstract: Legendrian knots and their exact Lagrangian fillings are central objects to study in low dimensional contact and symplectic topology. In recent developments, cluster algebras have proven to be powerful tools to classify Lagrangian fillings. For a positive braid link, we introduce a cluster K2 structure on its augmentation variety.  Using the perspective of Ekholm-Honda-Kalman theory, we prove that admissible exact Lagrangian fillings, a subset of decomposable ones, induce cluster seeds in the cluster K2 augmentation variety. We provide an algorithm to compute these cluster seeds. We also use the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation to produce infinitely many Lagrangian fillings. This is a joint work with L. Shen and D. Weng.

Title: Degree one maps between 4-manifolds with cyclic fundament groups


Abstract: I will present some results on the existence and finiteness of degree one maps between 4-manifolds with cyclic fundamental groups, as well as the relation between 1-domination and Euler characteristics. This is based on a joint work with Yang Su and Shicheng Wang.

Title: Triangulated persistence category in symplectic geometry


Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce a new algebraic structure called triangulated persistence category (TPC). A TPC combines the persistence module structure (from topological data analysis) and the classical triangulated structure so that a meaningful measurement, via cone decomposition, can be defined on the set of objects. Moreover, a TPC structure allows us to define non-trivial pseudo-metrics on its Grothendieck group, which is the first time that people can study a Grothendieck group in terms of the metric geometry. Finally, we will illustrate several unexpected properties of a TPC via its supporting example in symplectic geometry, the derived Fukaya category. In particular, we can distinguish classes in the Grothendieck group of a derived Fukaya category from a quantitative perspective. This is based on joint work with Paul Biran and Octav Cornea.

Title: Shadows of Hodge Theory (or: Never Underestimate Symmetry!)


Abstract: This talk aims to advertise a pattern/phenomenon that has emerged in many different mathematical areas during the past decades but is not currently well-understood. I will begin with a broad overview of the Kahler packages (Poincare duality, Hard Lefschetz, and Hodge-Riemann relations) that appear in geometry, algebra, and combinatorics, from the classics of Lefschetz to the recent work of this year's Fields medalist June Huh, in a down-to-earth way. Then I will discuss two new Kahler packages we discovered that are equivariant and have no geometric origin. The equivariant log-concavity in representation theory hints at our discoveries. This talk will be non-technical and accessible to the general audience: nothing will be assumed other than elementary linear algebra. Partly based on joint work with Rui Xiong.

Title: Free circle actions on highly connected (2n+1)- manifolds


Abstract: A natural problem in topology is to determine which manifolds admit certain group actions. The problem we concern in this talk is to determine which highly connected (2n+1)-manifolds admit free circle actions. I will introduce some previous work and our progress on this problem.
